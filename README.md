# Dotfiles

My dotfiles for programming, mainly vim and tmux-related.

## Highlights

- Use gruvbox colorscheme for neo(vim), tmux and kitty terminal.
- Use yabai as window manager together with skhd for keybindings.
- change-colors.py - Gruvboxify an image. Change all colors to their closest
  match in the gruvbox color palette.
- go\_to\_file\_in\_current\_dir.vim - Cycle through the files in the directory of
  the current buffer.
- lifeline.vim - Statusline with rounded corners.
- vimrc - Some useful mappings for a Swedish layout keyboard.
